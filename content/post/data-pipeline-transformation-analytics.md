## Understanding Analytics Engineering

### The Analytics Engineer Role

In traditional data teams, we recognize the data engineer, data analyst, and data scientist. However, a gap exists between these roles:

**Data Engineers** excel at building infrastructure and maintaining data pipelines but may lack deep understanding of business requirements and data usage patterns.

**Data Analysts** understand business needs and can derive insights from data but often lack software engineering skills for building scalable, maintainable solutions.

**Analytics Engineers** bridge this gap by combining:
- Software engineering practices from data engineering
- Business understanding from data analysis
- Modern cloud-based transformation tools

### Modern Data Stack Architecture

The analytics engineer typically works with:

- **Data Loading:** Stitch, Apache NiFi, Airbyte
- **Data Storing:** Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift
- **Data Modeling:** dbt, Dataform, Apache Spark SQL
- **Data Presentation:** Looker, Tableau, Google Data Studio, Power BI

### ELT vs ETL Methodology

**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** transforms data before loading into the warehouse, requiring upfront processing but ensuring data quality.

**ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** loads raw data first, then transforms within the warehouse, offering:
- Faster implementation
- Greater flexibility
- Leverages cloud warehouse compute power
- Lower storage costs

This approach capitalizes on cloud data warehousing advances that have dramatically reduced storage and compute costs.

## Introduction to dbt

### What is dbt?

dbt (data build tool) is a transformation workflow that enables analysts and engineers to transform data using SQL and Python. It sits on top of your data warehouse and helps convert raw data into analysis-ready datasets.

**Key Features:**

├── seeds/                # Static reference data
│   └── taxi_zone_lookup.csv
└── dbt_project.yml       # Project configuration
```

## Implementation: NYC Taxi Data Pipeline

### Staging Layer: Data Standardization

The staging layer cleanses and standardizes raw data using consistent patterns:

```sql
-- stg_green_tripdata.sql
{{ config(materialized='view') }}

with tripdata as (
  select *,
    row_number() over(partition by vendorid, lpep_pickup_datetime) as rn
  from {{ source('staging','green_tripdata') }}
  where vendorid is not null 
)
select
    -- identifiers
    {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['vendorid', 'lpep_pickup_datetime']) }} as tripid,
    {{ dbt.safe_cast("vendorid", api.Column.translate_type("integer")) }} as vendorid,
    
    -- timestamps
    cast(lpep_pickup_datetime as timestamp) as pickup_datetime,
    cast(lpep_dropoff_datetime as timestamp) as dropoff_datetime,
    
    -- payment info
    cast(fare_amount as numeric) as fare_amount,
    {{ get_payment_type_description("payment_type") }} as payment_type_description
from tripdata
where rn = 1
```

**Key Features:**
- **Deduplication:** Using ROW_NUMBER() for data quality
- **Type Casting:** Standardizing data types across sources
- **Surrogate Keys:** Generating unique identifiers
- **Macros:** Reusable transformation logic

### Core Layer: Dimensional Models

#### Dimension Tables

```sql
-- dim_zones.sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

select 
    locationid, 
    borough, 
    zone, 
    replace(service_zone,'Boro','Green') as service_zone 
from {{ ref('taxi_zone_lookup') }}
```

#### Fact Tables

```sql
-- fact_trips.sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

with green_tripdata as (
    select *, 'Green' as service_type
    from {{ ref('stg_green_tripdata') }}
), 
yellow_tripdata as (
    select *, 'Yellow' as service_type
    from {{ ref('stg_yellow_tripdata') }}
), 
trips_unioned as (
    select * from green_tripdata
    union all 
    select * from yellow_tripdata
)
select 
    trips_unioned.tripid,
    trips_unioned.service_type,
    pickup_zone.borough as pickup_borough,
    pickup_zone.zone as pickup_zone,
    dropoff_zone.borough as dropoff_borough,
    dropoff_zone.zone as dropoff_zone,
    trips_unioned.pickup_datetime,
    trips_unioned.fare_amount,
    trips_unioned.total_amount
from trips_unioned
inner join {{ ref('dim_zones') }} as pickup_zone
    on trips_unioned.pickup_locationid = pickup_zone.locationid
inner join {{ ref('dim_zones') }} as dropoff_zone
    on trips_unioned.dropoff_locationid = dropoff_zone.locationid
```

### Advanced dbt Features

#### Macros for Code Reusability

```sql
-- macros/get_payment_type_description.sql
{% macro get_payment_type_description(payment_type) -%}
    case {{ dbt.safe_cast("payment_type", api.Column.translate_type("integer")) }}  
        when 1 then 'Credit card'
        when 2 then 'Cash'
        when 3 then 'No charge'
        when 4 then 'Dispute'
        when 5 then 'Unknown'
        when 6 then 'Voided trip'
        else 'EMPTY'
    end
{%- endmacro %}
```

#### Variables for Environment Configuration

```sql
-- Development vs Production data limits
{% if var('is_test_run', default=true) %}
  limit 100
{% endif %}
```
